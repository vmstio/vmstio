# Data Security

Unless it's required of us to investigate a reported instance of abuse of our policies, under standard operation we have no ability to regularly access your direct messages with other members of our platform.
While this data is accessible with a request to our hosting providers database systems, we expect that to not be necessary except under extreme circumstances.
Where possible, we will notify you if such processes are taken for data associated by your account.

However, due in part to the open and federated nature of Mastodon instances, the Mastodon administrators of other instances you interact with may have access to your data.

While the connection to this site is encrypted, this is only the data in transit to you and to other servers in the federated network.
**The messages and data stored in the instance is not encrypted.**
This includes direct messages sent to other users of vmst·io!

This is not a choice of the administrator, but a limitation of the Mastodon platform.
Additionally, our hosting provider may have access to your data as part of the general administration of the server infrastructure.

You should use Signal, [Matrix](/matrix), or another E2E messaging app for the things you really want to be private.

## Privacy Policy

Please review our full [Privacy Policy](/tos) for more information.
