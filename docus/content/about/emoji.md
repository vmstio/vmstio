# Custom Emoji

We love our Custom Emoji here at vmst·io.

## Emoji List

A complete list of all the available options and their `:short_codes:` is [available via emojos.in](https://emojos.in/vmst.io).

## Requesting Emoji

Please note that you can see emoji render on statuses of other Mastodon users that are not on vmst.io, but those emojis are not locally hosted by vmst.io.If we're missing an emoji you just love from another instance, that you'd like to use, just ask us to add them. The best way is by submitting a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/vmstan/vmstio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Emoji&template=4-Emoji.yml).

## Profile Field Emoji

If you find one you'd like to include in your display name field, just copy and paste the short code into the field in your profile page.
