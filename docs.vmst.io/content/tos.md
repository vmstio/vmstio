## Mastodon Functionality

## Basic account information

If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password.
You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture and header image.
The username, display name, biography, profile picture and header image are always listed publicly.
You can only interact with other people's content and post your own content when you are logged in.
You may follow other people to view their combined posts in your own personalized home timeline.

## Posts, following and other public information

The list of people you follow is listed publicly, the same is true for your followers.
When you submit a message, the date and time is stored as well as the application you submitted the message from.
Messages may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos.
Public and unlisted posts are available publicly.
When you feature a post on your profile, that is also publicly available information.
Your posts are delivered to your followers, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there.
When you delete posts, this is likewise delivered to your followers.
The action of boosting or liking another post is always public.

## Direct and followers-only posts

All posts are stored and processed on the server.
Followers-only posts are delivered to your followers and users who are mentioned in them, and direct posts are delivered only to users mentioned in them.
In some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there.
We make a good faith effort to limit the access to those posts only to authorized persons, but other servers may fail to do so.
Therefore it's important to review servers your followers belong to.
You may toggle an option to approve and reject new followers manually in the settings.

Please keep in mind that it is technically possible for the operators of the server and any receiving server to view such messages, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them.

## IPs and Other Metadata

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:

* To provide the core functionality of Mastodon as defined above.

* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.

The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months.
